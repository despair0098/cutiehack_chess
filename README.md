# cutiehack_chess

This is the "Chess" class that is supposed to be done for CutieHack. My group did not have enough time to code all of these because we were overthinking about the classes' steup and how we code it. We spent like 4 hours brainstorming. 

We got the Piece class with 4 subclasses inherited from it. The subclasses have each own isMoveable() function with their own algorithm because each chess pieces move differently. I simply used a Strategy Pattern to have different algorithms.
